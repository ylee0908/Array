Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than âŒŠ n/2 âŒ‹ times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        d = dict()
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] in d:
                d[nums[i]] += 1
            else:
                d[nums[i]] = 1
        for k in d:
            if d[k] > len(nums)/2:
                return k
