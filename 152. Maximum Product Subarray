Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) 
which has the largest product.

Example 1:

Input: [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.


def maxProduct(nums):
    maximum=big=small=nums[0]
    for n in nums[1:]:
        big, small=max(n, n*big, n*small), min(n, n*big, n*small)
        maximum=max(maximum, big)
    return maximum
